Dear reader, this is a file describing the code used for the recent Phytopthora invasion paper by Bronkhorst et al.

The inputdata source of this paper is imaging data in a .nd2 format, taken using a nikon C2 confocal. 
Analysis was performed using matlab scripts, custom written and uploaded into this project.
The imaging data was structured in folders for each experiment with the label:
DATE_DETAILS_SPECIES_XXX, with XXX being the nth experiment in that series.
Inside of each folder, the raw .nd2 data is saved, as is the imaging data in .tif format (exported using nikon NIS software) in the format:
EXPERIMENTNAME_TX_TYYY_CHANNELNAME, with X being the acquisition series number (1,2,3,4), and YYY being the stacknumber (1st stack taken,
2nd stack etc) and CHANNELNAME the name of the PMT channel (eGFP, RhodamineB, TD etc).

Worked out data from the analysis scripts was saved in thesame folder as the original data folder.
The first code used for this are:
NFM_SigmoidalFit_Test_jb
This code runs the core algorymthn for the sigmoidal fitting routine on a chosen tif file (_RhodamineB.tif files are the correct input
for my datasets), full frame. A coarsening can be achieved by adjusting the scale_factor parameters to larger intergers, enabling
quick analysis of a sample to asses if it is useful.
An option to select which slices to analyse in the z-stack is present in the code, but generally all slices were taken.
The full frame of fiew analysis takes a rather long time (about 3 hours for a 512x512 pixel, 41 slices high z-stack), so an ROI selection
is useful to ensure quick analysis. Each ROI is saved (not automatically!) is saved in the original data folder.
To select a smaller ROI for analysis, the following code was used:
NFM_raw_analysis_jbv4_ROI_definer_FromGFP
This code runs a slice slection and XY selection on a chosen .tif file, and creates many of the input parameters in a strcut called param.
Don't forget to manually adjust these settings when analysing a new sample, any new settings like the XY sample size etc must be checked
manually. The code loads in 2 z-stacks, saves the .param containing the coordinates of the Field Of View in the present working directory.
The parameters.mat file containing the .param is used to generate the correct ROI window. The window and position are saved as a crude
image in this code as well, making a quick assesment of the chosen ROI possible.
The follwoing code uses the .param file to generate folders with the reuired data for sigmoidal analysis from the present .tif files:
NFM_SigmoidalFit_PrepareData_v2ROI
This codes uses the parameters.mat file containg the .param struct, as generated in ROI_definer to generate ROIs to analyse sigmoidally.
ROIs are much smaller then their parent full FOV, resulting in a much faster analysis. 
All timesteps (so each series/stacknumber) are saved in a unique folder, labbeled in the order of appearance in the dirlist. 
Ensure that the DIR command generates the list in the correct order!!!

After generation of the folders containing each timesteps ROI data, this workflow was used:
ROI_define -> Preparedata -> make a folder in the original data folder called ROIXXX
-> cut the data from the original data folder into the ROIXXX folder, including the parameters.mat and image files generated by the ROI_definer.
This flow ensures that no previous parameters.mat file is present in the original data folder, ensuring that no data mixing happens!!
The workflow can then be followed again to define a seond ROI, a third, etc.

After defining the correct ROIs,
